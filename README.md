# C++ practice

## Overview
Although I it is said to be C++ practice, it is not only limited to growing just my C++ skills but also other skills as well such as CMake, Figma, MS Visio and design patterns of both UI and software development


### CMake
"Practice" CMake refers to taking whatever I have learn't in the CMake-Journey repo and applying it into a relativly fully fledged application.
